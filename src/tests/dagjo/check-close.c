/*
 * Checks if child processes close open files properly.
 *
 * This file starts a child process that creates a file, opens it, and then crashes.
 *
 * If everything is correct, this program can then delete the file and create a new one.
 *
 * If the child process do not close its file, the remove will succeed but the old
 * file will remain in the file system, which causes the second create to fail
 * since the file system disk is full.
